# ImageProcessingLessons

During lessons, I worked on various computer vision and image processing techniques. The main topics and exercises included:
1. Histogram Analysis – Counting pixel intensities in images.
2. Filtering Techniques – Applying different filters in computer vision, such as low-pass, high-pass, and Laplace filters.
3. Thresholding – Adaptive and global thresholding, including Canny and Sobel edge detection.
4. Corner Detection – Using methods like Harris Corner Detector and HOG Descriptor (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) to identify key points in images.
5. Practical Applications – Implementing the above methods in laboratory exercises.
6. Transformations – Performing Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for frequency analysis and spectrum visualization.
7. Band-Pass Filter (BPF) – Applying BPF with masks for mid-range color frequencies.
8. Image Statistics – Calculating Standard Deviation (STD), correlation maps, and energy maps of images.
9. Extended Analysis – Expanding on point 8 with deeper exploration of image statistics and visualizations.
